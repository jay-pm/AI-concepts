The fundamental concepts of data and its significance in decision-making:

Data Context: Data gains value with context, which includes metadata like when or where data was collected. Context is essential for understanding the meaning behind the data.

Types of Data:

Structured Data: Organized and easy to analyze, often found in spreadsheets. Examples include sales records and weather data. 
Unstructured Data: Lacks a predefined format, such as videos or social media content. Though complex, it provides rich insights when processed. 

Quantitative vs. Qualitative Data: 
Quantitative Data: Numerical, suitable for calculations and visualizations. Examples include points scored and temperature. 
Qualitative Data: Categorical, useful for identifying patterns. Examples include customer feedback and favorite sports.
